  <p>I&rsquo;ll start out by saying that while this post will probably come across as cynical, I do genuinely want <a href="http://join.app.net">App.net</a> to work. Competition is always healthy  and what I&rsquo;ve seen of the Alpha platform so far is encouraging. Anyone who can raise $750,000 on Kickstarter is clearly onto something and should be taken seriously. There are, however, fundamental issues with the project&rsquo;s approach that are at odds with successful user-based services on the web.</p>

<h4>Twitter</h4>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get this one out of the way first. While App.net doesn&rsquo;t claim to be a competitor to Twitter, people will always compare the two. Describing App.net to a layperson in these early stages always results in the response: &ldquo;Oh, a micro-blogging service? Like Twitter?&rdquo;. Now I&rsquo;m not suggesting that Twitter&rsquo;s dominance of this medium should go unchallenged. The problem is this: <em>Twitter is fine</em>. It has its flaws, sure; the API is a little hokey and not amazingly well documented, it goes down from time to time, etc. But it&rsquo;s not doing anything badly enough to make users cry out for an alternative. As a developer (and historically amongst the main audience for the project) I really don&rsquo;t have any major problems with Twitter. In fact, if nothing else, App.net would simply become yet another platform to cater for, and as a lazy person I am opposed to this.</p>

<h4>Dalton Caldwell is building for Dalton Caldwell</h4>

<p>Watching the introductory <a href="http://vimeo.com/48111032">video</a> for App.net, presented by their founder and CEO, one thing jumped out at me. He says the words &lsquo;me&rsquo;, &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;we&rsquo; a hell of a lot. This project hasn&rsquo;t arisen from some great outcry amongst web users, it&rsquo;s arisen as a personal solution for Caldwell&rsquo;s own sense of feeling &lsquo;let down&rsquo; by free web 2.0 services. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with building for yourself, as long as you don&rsquo;t expect anyone else to care. I don&rsquo;t doubt that there are people out there that share his sentiment, and clearly there must be given the project&rsquo;s overwhelmingly popular response on Kickstarter; but when building a social network, solipsism isn&rsquo;t a great starting point.</p>

<h4>Kickstarter investment isn&rsquo;t real value</h4>

<p>While App.net did raise a hugely impressive three-quarters of a million on Kickstarter, this figure isn&rsquo;t really as significant as it sounds. Because it is made up of thousands of small donations, as opposed to several large ones, the money doesn&rsquo;t carry as much weight as that raised through VC or angel investment. The donators aren&rsquo;t looking for good ROI and therefore aren&rsquo;t evaluating it as a business venture, just as something they&rsquo;d like to see. Lots of things raise money on Kickstarter, and they <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/blog/outdoor-adventure/fatbike-expedition-comes-to-a-halt.html">aren&rsquo;t always profitable</a>.</p>

<h4>It isn&rsquo;t open source</h4>

<p>Despite the obvious attempt to appeal to developers, bizarrely App.net have overlooked what would surely be the best way to get people on board: open sourcing it. All the developers I know are cynical when it comes to branding and spiel, but give them an opportunity to tear something apart and figure out how it works and they&rsquo;ll be more likely to get on board. What&rsquo;s more is that a developer account for access to the API currently stands at $100 p/a &ndash; surely a huge barrier to casual developers and hackers looking to play around.</p>

<h4>It will never go mainstream</h4>

<p>One of the big selling points of App.net is that they are &lsquo;selling their product, not their users&rsquo;. By using a subscription payment model, there is no catering to advertisers or selling off data to third parties.  This is certainly a healthy ideology, and there&rsquo;s no denying that there are serious issues facing data privacy on social networks. The problem is that most people simply don&rsquo;t care about data privacy<em>. </em>Facebook&rsquo;s questionable approach to data protection has been blown open in the past few months, but has it affected user figures?</p>

<p>As for as advertising is concerned, advertisements invade our privacy every day, across every imaginable form of media. They are often well-targeted and invasive but we learn to filter them out. Premium models do work: mobile apps offering an ad-supported but free version or a no-ad premium version are becoming the norm; but the majority will always go for the free version. In this instance, the free version is Twitter.</p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;d go so far as to say that even if App.net were free, it would still not attract a paradigm-shiftingly large user base. Take Google+ as an example &ndash; it&rsquo;s a better product than Facebook in almost every way, but it hasn&rsquo;t attracted a large user-base because Facebook is so well established. For the average user it would be a hassle to migrate over to a new platform, and would mean bringing a substantial quotient of contacts with them (I tried this last year with Google+ and believe me, it doesn&rsquo;t work).</p>

<p>None of this is a problem if App.net is only interested in cultivating a niche, developer-centric community, but do developers really just want to build things for other developers? Given the choice between building an app for a potential platform of 100,000 or 100m, I know which one I&rsquo;d choose &ndash; especially if it has commercial intent.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to look back on this post in a couple of years time in the way we know scoff at news videos from the 80s saying nothing will ever come of the Internet. Sadly though, that&rsquo;s not going to happen until App.net start talking to more users and fewer Silicon Valley gentry.</p>
